### This is my first time using HUGO for static pages.

At first, I tried deploying something with Ruby on Rails  but nah…
Too complicated. Too much deploy drama. Too much everything.

So I ended up discovering **HUGO**.

And yeah… HUGO it is.

---

I guess my first topic *has* to be freaking **AI**.

This Artificial Intelligence thing is coming in **hot**, like a bullet train with no brakes.

## The Twitter AI Influencer™

If you’ve been scrolling Twitter lately, you’ve probably seen them too.

Those AI influencers constantly saying:

> *“AI is gonna take your job.
> My job.
> Everyone’s job.”*

And honestly?

Yeah… **I partially believe that.**
But I don’t think it’s going to be as drastic as they make it sound.

---

I won’t pretend I’m some senior wizard I’m a **mid-level software engineer**.
But from my perspective, there are still many layers AI can’t really reach.

At least for now.

Especially in:

- Complex products
- Messy or unclear business rules
- Projects that require **lots of meetings** just to understand what the client actually wants

Before AI even touches those layers, there’s still a **huge amount of human work** involved.

## A real example

I 100% wouldn’t have built this website in **30 minutes** if it weren’t for AI.

I had:
- Never heard about HUGO before  
- Never used it  
- Never even thought about it  

But with:
- Some prompting  
- Some documentation reading  

I managed to build a **fully functional weblog** including a **Figma design that I also prompted**.

That part?

Honestly… **that’s magical.**  
No denying it.

---

But this still feels like **the tip of the iceberg**.

AI is coming.  
And yeah  it’s coming in hot.

But if you:
- Know how to design systems  
- Communicate well  
- Solve real problems  

You’re a **way better asset** than four coding agents running 24/7 without context.

## Reality always hits production

At the end of the day, someone still has to deal with:

- Production issues  
- Clients who can’t specify what they want  
- Meetings with real humans  
- Extremely sensitive hotfixes  

Hotfixes that must be done with **extreme caution**.

Otherwise production goes:

**Bang Bong Kaboom**  

(Hello Cloudflare / AWS / etc )

---

So yeah  AI is really damn good at what it does.

But people who:
- Have strong fundamentals  
- Communicate well  
- And actually *want* to build things  

I think they’re gonna be just fine.
